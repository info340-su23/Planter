        <h3>Overview of Problem</h3>
        <p>
            In today’s society, sustainable practices and responsible consumption/production are becoming increasingly neglected, possibly as a result of an emerging discord between people and nature. It’s critical to begin considering the pressing issue of climate change before any more negative permanent ecological changes occur. Our generation has an opportunity to seize the rapidly advancing technology sector to apply a solution to this issue and promote environmental consciousness and sustainable practices through encouraging engagement and awareness.

            The source of our “nature deficit” is largely associated with urbanization, however as Seilin Kesbir explains it in A Growing Disconnection From Nature is Evident in Cultural Products it actually began in the 1950’s, with the rise of technology (Kesebir, 2017). Since the creation of the television, our society has traveled all the way to virtual realities, taking away the benefits of nature such as happiness, vitality, less fatigue, it has even been reported that patients who had plants in their hospital room required less pain killers than those without. Many studies have gone into and measured a significant decline in human-nature interactions, which we will aim to resolve by being the new bridge for.

        <h3>Prior Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            One type of solution to reconnect people and nature are planting apps. There are many existing websites that aim to inform people about the proper plants to grow in their region, for example <a href="https://www.nwf.org/nativeplantfinder/plants" target="_blank">Native Plant Finder</a> and <a href="https://www.gardenia.net/plant-finder" target="_blank">Plant Finder</a>. These web applications provide valuable features such as plant filtering by zip code, hardiness zone, heat zone, and more. Additionally, they also provide a description of the plant when it is selected, which further educates people on how to best care for their plants. However, the UX design for the majority of these existing applications is often overwhelming due to the inclusion of too much information and the lack of visual intuitiveness. Further, the region filtration is often extremely broad and confusing to individuals who do not know what hardiness, heat, or climate zone they are in. While these existing applications are valuable tools, there is a need for improvement in their functionality and features.

        <h2>Solution/Application Description</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h3>Who Is It For?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UW Students/Faculty who want to build a healthy habit that positively impacts climate change/sustainability
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>What Will It Do?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>User engagement: Allow users to post their own environmentally friendly tips! (develop a chat board)
            </li>
            <li>Promote sustainable practices: Teach users about what plants are right for them in their area! (Develop a search/filter plants by location/availability)
            </li>
            <li>
                Users can manage their plants? Track watering times / age / see what plants they own and what maintenance it requires? 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our solution will be a web application that educates and encourages those living in Seattle who want to build a new environmentally friendly habit in sustainability practices in their daily lives. Users will be able to engage with each other through posting their own experiences and recommendations for practice, chatting with each other on a board or forum about environmentally-friendly tips, organizing local clean-up events, and sharing existing resources or businesses directly implementing sustainability into their products. They will also be able to do more individual-based activities such as tracking their own plants, engaging in educational and user-friendly topics about different areas of sustainability, and reading Seattle-based news about environmental topics.

        <h3>What Information Is Involved?</h3>
        <p>
            Users will be able to access a database of plants and their respective information, as well as submit data of their own in order to track what plants they have, when to water them, e.t.c. Lastly, users will be able to post their own sustainability tips for others to see and learn more about how to be environmentally friendly.
        </p>

        <h3>How Will It Solve the Problem?</h3>
        <p>
            The intersection of sustainability and technology affords the ability to create a sustainable future. By equipping individuals with the motivation, tools, and knowledge to handle climate change and most importantly reconnecting individuals to nature, we hope that people can adopt more environmentally friendly practices and create a better path towards positive climate change. Our app additionally combats greenhouse gasses by getting more people involved with plant proliferation, sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere.
