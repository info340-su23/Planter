# Project Overview

Our solution will be a web application that educates and encourages those living in Seattle who want to build a new environmentally friendly habit in sustainability practices in their daily lives. Users will be able to engage with each other through posting their own experiences and recommendations for practice, chatting with each other on a board or forum about environmentally-friendly tips, organizing local clean-up events, and sharing existing resources or businesses directly implementing sustainability into their products. They will also be able to do more individual-based activities such as tracking their own plants, engaging in educational and user-friendly topics about different areas of sustainability, and reading Seattle-based news about environmental topics.

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.
